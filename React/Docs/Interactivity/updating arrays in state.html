    <h1>Updating arrays in state</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays are mutable in JS, but again, in JS, it should be treated as
      immutable. Similar to objects, a new one is needed for replacing the older
      ones if an update is needed.
    </p>
    <h2>Updating arrays without mutation</h2>
    <p>
      In JS, arrays is simply another type of object. It should be treated as
      read-only like the objects in React, meaning re-assignment like
      <code>arr[0]= 'reassigned stuff'</code> should not be done. Methods like
      <code>push()</code> and <code>pop()</code> leading to mutation should also
      be forbiddened.
    </p>
    <h2>Adding to array</h2>
    <p>
      To update a array, we can create a new array that contains all the
      information from previous array and add a new item at the end. Again, we
      can use the <code>spread</code> syntax <code>...</code>
    </p>
    <pre>
      setPeople{
        [
          ...People,
          {id: Id++, name:zhuolin}
        ]
      }
    </pre>

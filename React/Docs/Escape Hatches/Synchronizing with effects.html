    <h1>Synchronizing changes with effects</h1>
    <p>
      Some components may need to synchronize with external systems. For
      example, you may wish to send some logs when a component appears on
      screen. This can be done by Effects, which allows you to run some code
      after rendering.
    </p>
    <h2>Effects: what are they</h2>
    <p>
      Before learning Effects, we should know that there are two types of
      important logic in React:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rendering code: living in the top level of component, where it takes
        props and states, returning JSX you wish to see in screen. Rendering
        code must be pure, so no modification should be done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Event handlers: nested functions inside components that do things in
        response to certain events. They might contain 'side effects' caused by
        user actions (the 'certain events')
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Sometimes, these two types of logic are not enough. For example, we would
      wish to establish connection to another server when the control panel is
      rendered and visible in screen. This can't be done during rendering since
      it's an side effect. It's also impossible to complete via event handlers,
      since there are no events that cause the control panel to open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Effects enables specifying side effects that are caused by rendering
      itself, instead of any particluar event like a event handler. They run
      after the end of a commit after screen update, which is a good time for
      syncing with external AIPs
    </p>
    <h2>Writing a Effect</h2>
    <p>The three steps would create an Effect:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Declare an Effect: They will run after every render by default</li>
      <li>
        Specify Effect dependencies: most of them should only run when needed,
        rather than after every render. For example, a fade-out animination
        should only be triggered when a component is closed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add cleanup if needed: some effect need to specify how to stop, undo or
        clean after their have performed their job. For example,
        subscribe-unsubscribe, connect-reconnect-disconnect. This is known as
        cleanup function
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 1: Declare an Effect</h2>
    <p>
      First, import the <code>useEffect</code> hook. Then call it at the top
      level of component, and put some code in the Effect.
    </p>
    <pre>
      import { useEffect } from 'react';

      function MyComponent(){
        useEffect(()=> {
          //Code that runs after every render
        })
        return &lt;div/&gt;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      React would recognize the Effect, and 'delay' the code in Effect to run
      after render is completed. Considering a example of a video player:
    </p>
    <pre>
      function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) {
        const ref = useRef(null);
      
        if (isPlaying) {
          ref.current.play();  
        } else {
          ref.current.pause(); 
        }
        // rest of the code
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      This code would actually crash when rendered because it runs during
      render. The DOM does not exist yet when it's called, therefore returning
      an error
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this problem, we can either use a separate button tied with a
      event handler that controls the action, or we can use Effect to delay the
      code after rendering is done.
    </p>
    <p>
      function VideoPlayer({ src, isPlaying }) { const ref = useRef(null);
      useEffect(() => { if (isPlaying) { ref.current.play(); } else {
      ref.current.pause(); } }); return &lt;video ref={ref} src={src} loop
      playsInline /&gt;; }
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, we wrapped the DOM in Effect, so React would update the
      screen. Then, the Effect runs. When the <code>VideoPlayer</code> component
      renders, React would update the screen, creating a
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> tag in DOM with correct props. React would then
      run the Effect, which will call <code>play()</code> or
      <code>pause()</code> depending on the value of <code>isPlaying</code>
    </p>
    <div class="video" id="video"></div>
    <p>
      In this example, the external system that was synchronized with React was
      the browser media API.
    </p>
    <p>
      A very important thing to note is that, Effect may lead to infinite loops
      when incorrectly used. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
      const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
      useEffect(()=>{
        setCount(count + 1)
      })
    </pre>
    <p>
      Since Effect runs after render, and updating a state would trigger a
      re-render. This code would lead to infinite re-renders as a closed
      infinite loop. Therefore, Effects should usually synchronize the component
      with an external system.
    </p>
    <h2>Stpe 2: Setting Effect dependencies</h2>
    <p>
      Effect runs after every render by default. However, this might not be what
      you want since it's slow and may cause unnecessary runs.
    </p>
    <p>
      For exmaple, we could have a input at the same level of the video example
      before, where each inupt would trigger an update in the entire parent
      level. This would also trigger Effect after each render, which is not
      needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this problme, we can tell React to skip Effect by specifying an
      array of dependencies as the second argument in the
      <code>useEffect</code> call.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are three different possible configurations in Effect dependencies:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        useEffect(()=>{ <br />
        <i>// This runs after every render</i> <br />
        })
      </li>
      <li>
        useEffect(()=>{ <br />
        <i
          >// This runs only on mount (when the component appears for the first
          time)</i
        >
        <br />
        }, [])
      </li>
      <li>
        useEffect(()=>{ <br />
        <i
          >// This runs on mount AND if either a or b have changed since last
          render.</i
        >
        <br />
        },[a,b])
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Back in our video player example, we shall only use the third option
      containing <code>isPlaying</code> as the dependency. Because the Effect
      starts with <code>if (isPlaying)</code>, so it must be included as a
      dependency.
    </p>
    <p>Therefore, the code after we added a dependency is modified to:</p>
    <pre>
    useEffect(() => {
      if (isPlaying) {
        ref.current.play();
      } else {
        ref.current.pause();
      }
    },[isPlaying]);
    </pre>
    <p>
      Now it would skip the code in Effect if <code>isPlaying</code> is the same
      after render. Note that the <code>ref</code> is omitted in the dependency
      because it has a stable identity that React will always remember: it will
      never change by it self. However, if the ref is passed from the parent
      level component, then it must be specified in dependencies, since the
      Effect can't tell if the ref passed down is always the same
    </p>
    <h2>Step 3: Add cleanup (if needed)</h2>
    <p>
      Imagine building a chatroom with React. We would wish to render it only
      once - on mount. This can easily be achived by using an empty array as
      dependency like:
    </p>
    <pre>
      useEffect(()=>{
        const connection = createConnection();
        connection.connect();
      },[]);
    </pre>
    <p>
      However, imagine the user decided to check something in his profile during
      chatting, so he left the chatroom and return a while later. Now the page
      has refreshed, and the connection would be started again. But the previous
      connection wasn't destroyed yet, which may cause problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      To solve this issue, we can add a cleanup function by the
      <code>return</code> syntax.
    </p>
    <pre>
      useEffect(()=>{
        const connection = createConnection();
        connection.connect();
        return()=>{
          connection.disconnect();
        };
      },[]);
    </pre>
    <p>
      React would call the cleanup function each time before the Effect runs
      again, and one time when the component unmounts (removed). This is the
      correct behaviour in development since there should always be cleanup
      function that undo the Effect's changes. The users shouldn't be able to
      distinguish the difference between <i>mount</i> and
      <i>mount-cleanup(unmount)-mount</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>Example: Controlling non-React widgets</h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes we may wish to add UI pieces that are from external APIs. For
      example, using browser API <code>showModal</code> to trigger a dialog box.
      We shall add a cleanup function so that it won't be triggered twice
      causing bugs.
    </p>
    <pre>
      useEffect(()=> {
        const dialog = dialog.Ref.current;
        dialog.showModal();
        return() => dialog.close();
      }, []);
    </pre>
    <h3>Example: Subscribing to events</h3>
    <p>
      if your Effect subscribes to something, the cleanup function should
      unsubscribe so that there is no multiple subscription at a time.
    </p>
    <pre>
      useEffect(()=>{
        function handleSomething(){
          // some actions
        }
        something.addEventListener('action', handleSomething)
        return()=> something.removeEventListener('action', handleSomething)
      }, [])
    </pre>
    <h3>Exmaple: triggering animation</h3>
    <p>
      If the Effect animates something in, the cleanup function should restore
      it to the initial values so that when it runs again, it will start from
      scratch instead of where it's left in last render.
    </p>
    <pre>
      useEffect(()=>{
        const node = ref.current;
        node.style.opacity = 1;
        return()=> {
          node.style.opacity = 0;
        };
      },[])
    </pre>
    <h3>Example: Fetching data</h3>
    <p>
      If the Effect fetches somthing, the cleanup should either abort the fetch
      or ignore the result
    </p>
    <pre>
      useEffect(()=> {
        let ignore = false;
        
        async function startFetching(){
          const json = await fetchInfo(userId);
          if(!ignore){
            setInfo(json);            
          }
        }
        
        startFetching()

        return()=> {
          ignore = true;
        }
      }, [userId])
    </pre>
    <p>
      Unlike previous example, a network request can't be undone. However, the
      cleanup function should stop the fetch that's not requested anymore. For
      example, if the <code>userId</code> changed after cleanup, the information
      that arrived will still be ignored.
    </p>
    <h3>Exmaple: Initializing the application</h3>
    <p>
      if some logic are meant to only run once when the application starts, it
      can be placed outside of the component. This is to ensure that it will
      only run once after browser runs the page:
    </p>
    <pre>
      if (typeof window !== 'undefined'){
        checkSomething()
      }
      
      function App(){
        // ...
      }
    </pre>
    <h3>Example: buying a product</h3>
    <p>
      Buying a product should NOT be placed in a Effect. Because you don't wish
      the user to purchase the same thing when they pressed the back button or
      everytime they revisit the page. It should be user-action inflicted like a
      eventListener.
    </p>

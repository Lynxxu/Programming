    <h1>Manipulating DOM with refs</h1>
    <p>
      React would automatically update the DOM to match the render output. The
      components don't have to do anything. However, sometimes we may wish to
      access React's DOM element for some purpose. We can do such with refs, as
      there's no built-in method for it.
    </p>
    <h2>ref to node</h2>
    <p>
      To access DOM managed by React, import and decalre the ref in the
      component, and pass the ref as a <code>ref</code> attribute to JSX tag for
      the desired node:
    </p>
    <pre>
        import { useRef } from "react";
        const myRef = useRef(null);

        function Example() {
        return &lt;div ref={myRef}&gt;Text&lt;/div&gt;;
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
      With the above code, React puts a reference to the
      <code>div</code> element that it creates into <code>myRef.current</code>.
      Now this DOM element can be accessed using event handlers and built-in
      browser APIs like <code>myRef.current.scrollIntoView()</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we can create a input with a button that can focus the input
    </p>
    <div id="input"></div>
    <pre>
    function InputButton() {
        const inputRef = useRef(null);
        return (
            &lt;&gt;
            &lt;input ref={inputRef} /&gt;
            &lt;button
                onClick={() =&gt; {
                inputRef.current.focus();
                }}
            &gt;
                Focus the input
            &lt;/button&gt;
            &lt;/&gt;
        );
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is done by storing the input DOM element in a ref, and manipulate the
      eleemnt by calling <code>focus()</code> method on it. This is the main use
      case for refs, but refs can certainly be used in other situations like API
      calls.
    </p>
    <div id="gallery"></div>
    <p>
      See the gallery above, it is composed of three buttons and three images.
      The three images are created each with a specific ref. The refs are
      manipulated by the corresponding buttons by
      <code>scrollIntoView()</code> method.
    </p>
    <h2>Accessing other component's DOM</h2>
    <p>
      When a ref is set on a built-in component that renders a browser element.
      They works fine, react would set the ref's <code>current</code> property
      to the corresponding DOM node.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, when a ref is placed on a custom component build by your own,
      they'll get null. For example:
    </p>
    <pre>
    
    function MyInput(props) {
      return &lt;input {...props} /&gt;;
    }

    export default function MyForm() {
      const inputRef = useRef(null);

      function handleClick() {
        inputRef.current.focus();
      }

      return (
        &lt;&gt;
          &lt;MyInput ref={inputRef} /&gt;
          &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;
            Focus the input
          &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
      );
    }  
    </pre>
    <p style="color: red">
      Warning: Function components cannot be given refs. Attempts to access this
      ref will fail. Did you mean to use React.forwardRef()?
    </p>
    <p>
      This occurs since React does not let a component access others' DOM node
      for the purpose of making the code stronger. To access another component's
      DOM, the component must expose their DOM nodes to opt in to that
      behaviour. The component can specify that it forwards its ref to children,
      so the ref will be passed down.
    </p>
    <pre>
      const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref)=>{
        return &lt;input {...props} ref={ref}/&gt;;
      });
    </pre>
    <p>
      <code>&lt;MyInput ref={inputRef}&gt;</code> would tell React to put the
      DOM node into <code>inputRef.current</code>, but that component is not
      opted in to such behaviour, so the ref would have a <code>null</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When <code>MyInput</code> component is declared using
      <code>forwardRef</code>, it opts it into receiving
      <code>inputRef</code> from above, as the second <code>ref</code> argument,
      declared after props. Then, <code>MyInput</code> would pass the
      <code>ref</code> that it receives into the <code>input</code> in it.
    </p>
    <pre>
      
    const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) =&gt; {
      return &lt;input {...props} ref={ref} /&gt;;
    });

    function Form() {
      const inputRef = useRef(null);
      return (
        &lt;&gt;
          &lt;MyInput ref={inputRef} /&gt;
          &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; inputRef.current.focus()}&gt;Focus&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
      );
    }
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is a pretty standard pattern for low-level components like buttons
      and inputs to forward their ref to their DOM nodes. Higher level DOMs like
      forms, lists and page sections won't expose their DOM to avoid unnecessary
      dependencies on DOM.
    </p>
    <div id="form"></div>
    <h2>Process of attaching refs</h2>
    <p>
      In React, every update is split into two phases: render and commit. Render
      is where React calls the component to figure out what to show on scree,
      commit is where React applies the change to DOM.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, we don't want to access refs during rendering. Since during
      first render, DOM nodes are not yet created, so
      <code>ref.current</code> would be null. React would set
      <code>ref.current</code> during commit, before updating DOM,
      <code>ref.current</code> would have value to null. After updating, React
      sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.
    </p>
    <h2>Best practices for DOM manipulation with ref</h2>
    <p>
      Before using Refs, remember that they are escape hatches. They should only
      be used when you have to step outside React. This includes managing focus,
      scroll position or calling APIs. Non-destructive actions like focusing and
      scrolling should be fine. However, when DOM is modified manually by refs,
      it is possible to conflict with changes React is making
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule of thumb, avoid changing DOM element managed by React. This
      include modifying, adding children to, or removing children from elements
      managed by React, as it could lead to inconsistent visual results or
      crashes. For DOM element that React won't update, they can be safely
      modified. For example, if a <code>div</code> is always empty in JSX, React
      won't access it at all, so you can edit it as you wish.

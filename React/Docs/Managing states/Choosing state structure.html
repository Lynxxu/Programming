    <h1>Principles for structuring states</h1>
    <p>
        Structuring a component properly would help in modifying and debugging, Some principles of designing/structuring
        states are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Group related states: if there are two or more state variables that are always updated together, it would be
            a good idea to merge them together into a single variable.</li>
        <li>Avoid contradictions in states: If states are structured such that they may conflict with other states, it
            is a potential source of mistake that needs to be avoided.</li>
        <li>Avoid redundant states: if some of the information can be calculated from the props or the existing states,
            don't create a new state for them</li>
        <li>Avoid duplication in states: When same data are duplicated betwee nstate or nested objects, they may be
            difficulte to be kept in sync. Reduce duplication</li>
        <li>Avoid deeply nested states: Deeply nested (hierarchial) states are very hard to update. Flat way are
            preferred.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Group related states</h2>
    <p>
        To properly choose between single or multiple states, the best way is to check if the variables are always
        changed together. Using the cursor track example, we would rather prefer using the second example below.
    </p>
    <pre>
        const [x, setX] = useState(0);
        const [y, setY] = useState(0);
    </pre>
    <p>or</p>
    <pre>
        const [position, setPosition] = useState({x:0,y:0});
    </pre>
    <p>
        However, if a state variable is an object, they should be updated together instaed of setting one alone. For
        example, if setting <code>x</code> alone while not changing <code>y</code>, then only x will be defined and y
        won't even exist. A good way to setX(100)
    </p>
    <h2>Avoid contradictions in state</h2>
    <div id="form1"></div>
    <p>
        As seen above is a example of a form that returns a thank you message once the reply is sent. This works by
        defining three state variables that determines the state of the component like below:
    </p>
    <pre>
        const [text, setText] = useState('');
        const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false);
        const [isSent, setIsSent] = useState(false);
      
        async function handleSubmit(e) {
          e.preventDefault();
          setIsSending(true);
          await sendMessage(text);
          setIsSending(false);
          setIsSent(true);
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this case, the code works but it generates a impossible state, where the state <code>isSending</code> and
        <code>isSent</code> could be true at the same time, which is not possible. This may lead to bugs in complex
        components.
    </p>
    <p>
        To avoid this problem, we can replace <code>isSending</code> and <code>isSent</code> with a single variable
        called <code>status</code> that can take one of three different states such as <code>typing</code>,
        <code>sending</code> and <code>sent</code>.
    </p>
    <pre>
        const [text, setText] = useState('');
        const [status, setStatus] = useState('typing');

        async function handleSubmit(e) {
            e.preventDefault();
            setStatus('sending');
            await sendMessage(text);
            setStatus('sent');
        }

        const isSending = status === 'sending';
        const isSent = status === 'sent';
    </pre>
    <p>
        In the above example, the status is declared as a state variable, and it can also be used to define status such
        as sending or sent by simple boolean expressions. To
    </p>
    <h2>Avoid redudant state</h2>
    <p>
        For information that can be calculated from other states, they should not be separately stored into states. An
        example could be:
    </p>
    <pre>
        const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Will')
        const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Chalin')
        const [fullName, setFullName] = useState(Will Chalin')

        function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
            setFirstName(e.target.value);
            setFullName(e.target.value + ' ' + lastName);
          }
        
          function handleLastNameChange(e) {
            setLastName(e.target.value);
            setFullName(firstName + ' ' + e.target.value);
          }
    </pre>
    <p>
        The above exmaple used a state called fullName, which can be directly calculated from <code>firstName</code> and
        <code>lastName</code> anytime during render. It should be removed for simplicity
    </p>
    <pre>
        const [firstName, setFirstName] = useState('Will')
        const [lastName, setLastName] = useState('Chalin')
        const fullName = firstName + ' ' + lastName

        function handleFirstNameChange(e) {
            setFirstName(e.target.value);
          }
        
          function handleLastNameChange(e) {
            setLastName(e.target.value);
          }
    </pre>
    <h2>Avoid state duplication</h2>
    <p>
        The example below is a list that allows you to choose your team. However, the input update does not relfect the
        edit simultaneously.
    </p>
    <div id="form2"></div>
    <p>
        The source code explains the reason
    </p>
    <pre>
        const initialTeam = [
        { name: "Hoshino", id: 0 },
        { name: "Serika", id: 1 },
        { name: "Ayane", id: 2 },
        { name: "Shiroko", id: 3 },
        ];

        function Team() {
        const [team, setTeam] = useState(initialTeam);
        const [selectedMember, setSelectedMember] = useState(team[0]);

        function handleTeamChange(id, e) {
        setTeam(
            team.map((member) =&gt; {
            if (member.id === id) {
                return { ...member, name: e.target.value };
            } else {
                return member;
            }
            })
        );
        }

        return (
        &lt;&gt;
            &lt;h2&gt;What's the members of your team?&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            {team.map((member) =&gt; (
                &lt;li key={member.id}&gt;
                &lt;input
                    value={member.name}
                    onChange={(e) =&gt; {
                    handleTeamChange(member.id, e);
                    }}
                /&gt;{" "}
                &lt;button
                    onClick={() =&gt; {
                    setSelectedMember(member);
                    }}
                &gt;
                    choose
                &lt;/button&gt;
                &lt;/li&gt;
            ))}
            &lt;/ul&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;U picked {selectedMember.name}&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/&gt;
        );
        }
    </pre>
    <p>
        In this code snippet, we have created a function that handles the change in team. It works by storing the
        updated member value in <code>selectedMember</code>. This means that objects in <code>team</code> is the same
        object in <code>selectedMember</code>. Therefore, the information is <b>duplicated</b> while
        <code>selectedMember</code> is not updated.
    </p>
    <p>
        One solution to this problem is storing the id of the selected member in a new state called
        <code>selectedId</code>. Then create <code>selectedMemeber</code> state from searching the id in the array.
        Therefore the member is re-rendered once updated since there is no duplication that needs more update.
    </p>
    <div id="form3"></div>
    <h2>Avoid deeply nested state</h2>
    <div id="form4"></div>
    <p>
        see the list above, it is made from the object below. It can be considered as a very nested list that is hard to
        maintain and update. For example, if I would like to delete a student from a particular academy, I would need to
        update all of the parent nodes, which is very inconvenient.
    </p>
    <pre>
        const studentList = {
            id: 0,
            title: "Kivotos",
            childAcademies: [
              {
                id: 1,
                title: "Abydos",
                childStudents: [
                  {
                    id: 2,
                    name: "Shiroko",
                  },
                  {
                    id: 3,
                    name: "Serika",
                  },
                  {
                    id: 4,
                    name: "Hoshino",
                  },
                ],
              },
            }
    </pre>
    <p>
        To solve this problem, we can simply use a <b>flat</b> state, which uses id to indicate parent-children relation
        between objects. It is not nested, so operations can be done relatively easily
    </p>
    <div id="form5"></div>
    <p>
        The above student attendence list can now be completed by pressing the button. The easy state update is done by
        the flat dataset below. The flat data enables filtering of ID through the parent level. Thus only two states,
        <code>parentId</code> and <code>ChildId</code> are involved, which make things so much easier.
    </p>
    <pre>

const studentListFlat = {
    0: {
      id: 0,
      title: "Kivotos",
      childIds: [1, 5],
    },
    1: {
      id: 1,
      title: "Abydos",
      childIds: [2, 3, 4],
    },
    2: {
      id: 2,
      title: "Shiroko",
      childIds: [],
    },
    3: {
      id: 3,
      title: "Serika",
      childIds: [],
    },
    4: {
      id: 4,
      title: "Hoshino",
      childIds: [],
    },
    5: {
      id: 5,
      title: "Trinity",
      childIds: [6, 7, 8],
    },
    6: {
      id: 6,
      title: "Hanako",
      childIds: [],
    },
    7: {
      id: 7,
      title: "Hifumi",
      childIds: [],
    },
    8: {
      id: 8,
      title: "Azusa",
      childIds: [],
    },
  };

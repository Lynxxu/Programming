    <h1>Preserving and resetting states</h1>
    <p>
      States are isolated between components, they are tracked based on their
      place in UI tree. States can be preserved or reseted between re-renders.
    </p>
    <h2>UI Tree</h2>
    <p>
      Browers use tree structures to model UI, DOM tree represents HTML element,
      CSSOM represents CSS. Similarly, React manages UI via a tree structure
      from the <b>JSX</b>. The React DOM updates the brower DOM element to match
      the UI tree. Basically, React creates a UI tree from the components. The
      UI tree is then used by React to render the browser DOM
    </p>
    <h2>State is tied to a position in tree</h2>
    <p>
      See the example showed below. It is a simple counter that lets the user to
      vote for a student. Each click will increase the count for one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each counter is made by <code>&Lt;Counter /&gt;</code> tag. They are
      rendered from the same jsx but in different position in the tree, which
      makes it two separate counters independent from each other.
    </p>
    <div id="counters"></div>
    <p>
      In React, each component has fully isolated states, using the above
      example, each counter would have their own independent
      <code>score</code> and <code>hover</code> states. React will keep the
      state as long as the same component is rendered at the same position.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we stop rendering the shiroko counter by clicking the checkbox, its
      states disappears entirely since React destroys the state when it remove a
      component. Clicking the checkbox again, and React would render the second
      counter again, with states initialized from scratch and added to the DOM.
      Basically, React would preserve the state if it's rendered at its position
      in the UI tree while destroying the states if the components are removed
    </p>
    <h2>Preservation of states</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned before, React preserves the state if it's the same component
      at the same position. See the example below.
    </p>
    <div id="Fancy" class="counters"></div>
    <p>This counter is written with this logic:</p>
    <pre>
        {isFancy ? (
            &lt;Counter isFancy={true} /&gt;
          ) : (
            &lt;Counter isFancy={false} /&gt; 
          )}
    </pre>
    <p>
      Every time we click the checkbox, the counter state does not reset whether
      <code>isFancy</code> is true or not. There is always a
      <code>Counter </code>as the first child of <code>div</code> from the root
      component. Therefore, it is the same component from the same position in
      the UI tree, React would think it as the same counter and preserve the
      state, which is the number count in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that, what matters is the position in the UI tree.
      The JSX markup does not matter as long as the components are rendered in
      the same position in the tree. For example, we can write JSX markup like
      below:
    </p>
    <pre>
        if (isFancy){
            return(
                &lt;Counter isFancy ={true}&gt;
            )
        }

        return(
            &lt;Counter isFancy ={false}&gt;
        )
    </pre>
    <p>
      Since the function only returns once. It will render the UI based on the
      <code>isFancy</code> boolean. However, by clicking the checkbox to
      add/remove styling won't reset the states because the both of the
      <code>Counter</code> components are rendered at the same position in the
      tree. Therefore, React matches them before and after render, and preserves
      the state regardless of the JSX markup logic.
    </p>
    <h2>Different components at the same position - reset state</h2>
    <div id="pCounter" class="counters"></div>
    <p>
      See the example above. You can click the counter for a few times and take
      a break by cliking the checkbox two times. The counter would show up again
      but with states re-initilized.
    </p>
    <p>
      What happens in this process is that, we switched to different components
      at the same position. It was initially
      <code>Counter</code>, but then changed to <code>p</code>. React recognizes
      that as a different component, and removes the <code>Counter</code> from
      the UI tree and destoryes its state. The same process goes again when we
      switched from <code>p</code> to <code>Counter</code>, as
      <code>Counter</code> would be added to the UI tree with its states
      re-initialized.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is important to note that, the component reset would affect the entire
      substructure. See the fancy styling again:
    </p>
    <div id="fancy2" class="counters"></div>
    <p>
      From the example above, it can be seen that the counter would reset once
      the style is updated. This is different from the previous example, because
      the parent level was changed, which leads to reset of the entire sub
      structure. See the parent wrapper noted above the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore, when we wish to preserve a state between re-renders, we have to
      make sure that the structure of the tree are matched. This is also the
      reason why we should avoid nesting functions definitions, as the nested
      function could have very unstable states everytime the parent function
      re-renders.
    </p>
    <h2>Resetting state at the same position</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes we would like to reset the state of a component while it stays
      at the same position. To override the default behaviour, we can use the
      following ways :
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Render the components in different positions</li>
      <li>Give each components a unique <code>key</code></li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1. Render component in different position</h3>
    <p>
      Again using the counter example, if we want them to be independent from
      each other, we can render them in different position.
    </p>
    <div id="diffcounter" class="counters"></div>
    <p>The above example is written using this logic:</p>
    <pre>
    &lt;div&gt;
        {isNext && &lt;Counter name="奥空アヤネ" /&gt;}
        {!isNext && &lt;Counter name="小鳥遊 ホシノ" /&gt;}
    &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Everytime the counter changes by pressing the button, the original
      component is destoryed and the new component is rendered. This is because
      they are in a different position. They all belongs to the same parent
      level but in different position of the UI tree. This method is convenient
      and could be used when there aren't many components to be rendered in the
      same place.
    </p>
    <h3>2. Resetting with a key</h3>
    <p>
      A second way to reset the state of a component is via a key. They have
      been present in
      <a href="../Describing UI/Rendering.html">Rendering lists</a>. But they
      are more than that, React could distinguish between any components by
      keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      by default, React uses order within parent to discern components (first,
      second, third, etc). With keys, React would know that the component is a
      specifc one to the key, instead of recognizing via the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, with keys, we are able to have the following effect, where
      the two components are at the same position but resets everytime the
      button is clicked.
    </p>
    <div id="resetC" class="counters"></div>
    <p>
      The example above is created by the logic below. Note that the components
      are at the same position. If the keys are removed, React would easily
      recognize them as the same element.
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;&gt;
        {isNext ? (
        &lt;Counter key="Akane" name="奥空アヤネ" /&gt;
        ) : (
        &lt;Counter key="Hoshino" name="小鳥遊 ホシノ" /&gt;
        )}
        &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setIsNext(!isNext)}&gt;Next Student&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
    </pre>
  </body>

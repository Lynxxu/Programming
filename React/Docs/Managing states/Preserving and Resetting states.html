    <h1>Preserving and resetting states</h1>
    <p>
        States are isolated between components, they are tracked based on their place in UI tree. States can be
        preserved or reseted between re-renders.
    </p>
    <h2>UI Tree</h2>
    <p>
        Browers use tree structures to model UI, DOM tree represents HTML element, CSSOM represents CSS. Similarly,
        React manages UI via a tree structure from the <b>JSX</b>. The React DOM updates the brower DOM element to match
        the UI tree. Basically, React creates a UI tree from the components. The UI tree is then used by React to render
        the browser DOM
    </p>
    <h2>State is tied to a position in tree</h2>
    <p>
        See the example showed below. It is a simple counter that lets the user to vote for a student. Each click will
        increase the count for one.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each counter is made by <code>&Lt;Counter /&gt;</code> tag. They are rendered from the same jsx but in different
        position in the tree, which makes it two separate counters independent from each other.
    </p>
    <div id="counters"></div>
    <p>
        In React, each component has fully isolated states, using the above example, each counter would have their own
        independent <code>score</code> and <code>hover</code> states. React will keep the state as long as the same
        component is rendered at the same position.
    </p>
    <p>
        If we stop rendering the shiroko counter by clicking the checkbox,
        its states disappears entirely since React destroys the state when it remove a component. Clicking the checkbox
        again, and React would render the second counter again, with states initialized from scratch and added to the
        DOM. Basically, React would preserve the state if it's rendered at its position in the UI tree while destroying
        the states if the components are removed
    </p>
    <h2>Preservation of states</h2>
    <p>
        As mentioned before, React preserves the state if it's the same component at the same position. See the example
        below.
    </p>
    <div id="Fancy" class="counters"></div>
    <p>
        This counter is written with this logic:
    </p>
    <pre>
        {isFancy ? (
            &lt;Counter isFancy={true} /&gt;
          ) : (
            &lt;Counter isFancy={false} /&gt; 
          )}
    </pre>
    <p>
        Every time we click the checkbox, the counter state does not reset whether <code>isFancy</code> is true or not.
        There is always a <code>Counter </code>as the first child of <code>div</code> from the root component.
        Therefore, it is the same component from the same position in the UI tree, React would think it as the same
        counter and preserve the state, which is the number count in it.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that, what matters is the position in the UI tree. The JSX markup does not matter as
        long as the components are rendered in the same position in the tree. For example, we can write JSX markup like
        below:
    </p>
    <pre>
        if (isFancy){
            return(
                &lt;Counter isFancy ={true}&gt;
            )
        }

        return(
            &lt;Counter isFancy ={false}&gt;
        )
    </pre>
    <p>
        Since the function only returns once. It will render the UI based on the <code>isFancy</code> boolean. However,
        by clicking the checkbox to add/remove styling won't reset the states because the both of the
        <code>Counter</code> components are rendered at the same position in the tree. Therefore, React matches them
        before and after render, and preserves the state regardless of the JSX markup logic.
    </p>
    <h2>Different components at the same position - reset state</h2>
    <div id="pCounter" class="counters"></div>
    <p>
        See the example above. You can click the counter for a few times and take a break by cliking the checkbox two
        times. The counter would show up again but with states re-initilized.
    </p>
    <p>
        What happens in this process is that, we switched to different components at the same position. It was initially
        <code>Counter</code>, but then changed to <code>p</code>. React recognizes that as a different component, and
        removes the <code>Counter</code> from the UI tree and destoryes its state. The same process goes again when we
        switched from <code>p</code> to <code>Counter</code>, as <code>Counter</code> would be added to the UI tree with
        its states re-initialized.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is important to note that, the component reset would affect the entire substructure. See the fancy styling
        again:
    </p>
    <div id="fancy2" class="counters"></div>
    <p>
        From the example above, it can be seen that the

    <h1>Extracting state logic into a Reducer</h1>
    <p>
      Components could get very complicated when they spread acorss many event
      handlers. Their states can be updated outside the component scope, in a
      single function called <b>reducer</b>
    </p>
    <h2>Consolidate state logic with reducer</h2>
    <p>
      When components grows more complex, they can be difficult to analyze. For
      example, the list below has an array of students in state, and uses three
      event handlers to add, remove and edit student's info.
    </p>
    <div id="studentList"></div>
    <p>
      In this example, each of the event handlers would call
      <code>studentList</code> state, which stores the array of students, to
      update the states. The logic would grow increasing complex as component
      grows. To reduce complexity, we can move all the state logic into a single
      function outside the component called <b>reducer</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, we can change from <code>useState</code> to
      <code>useReducer</code> in three steps
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Move from setting state to dispatching actions</li>
      <li>Write a reducer function</li>
      <li>Use the reducer from the component</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Step 1: Move from setting states to dispathcing actions</h2>
    <p>
      The event handlers will specify what to do by setting the state. The
      example below is the three event handlers from the student list. They sets
      the state.
    </p>
    <pre>
      function handleAddStudent(name) {
        setStudentList([
          ...studentList,
          {
            id: nextId++,
            name: name,
            done: false,
          },
        ]);
      }

      function handleChangeStudents(student) {
        setStudentList(
          studentList.map((s) => {
            if (s.id === student.id) {
              return student;
            } else {
              return s;
            }
          })
        );
      }

      function handleDeleteStudent(studentId) {
        setStudentList(studentList.filter((s) => s.id !== studentId));
      }
    </pre>
    <p>Discard all the state setting logic, then we would have:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>handleAddStudent</code>, when the user presses Add</li>
      <li>
        <code>handleChangeStudent</code> when the user presses edit or save
      </li>
      <li><code>handleDeleteStudent</code> when the user presses delete</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Managing states via reducer is different from setting states, since we are
      telling React what the user did, instead of what to do (which is setting
      the state). We specify what the user did by dispatching actions from the
      event handlers, and the state update will in somewhere else. This is a
      more descriptive of the user's intent.
    </p>
    <pre>
      function handleAddStudent(name) {
        dispatch({
          type: "added",
          id: nextId++,
          name: name,
        });
      }
      
      function handleChangeStudent(student) {
        dispatch({
          type: "changed",
          student: student,
        });
      }
      
      function handleDeleteStudent(studentId) {
        dispatch({
          type: "deleted",
          id: studentId,
        });
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      In these functions, we pass objects to <code>dispatch</code>. These
      objects are called actions, which are regular JS object that contains
      minmal information about what happen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The action object can have any shape, it is common to give a string
      <code>type</code> that describes what happened. Any additional details are
      passed in other field. It is important to note that the
      <code>type</code> is specific to a component, so choose a name that best
      describe what happens
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: Write a reducer function</h3>
    <p>
      a reducer function is where the state logic lives in. It usually takes two
      argument, the current state and the action object, returning the next
      state. It will have a basic structure of the following:
    </p>
    <pre>
      function yourReducer(state, action){
        // return next state for React to set
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      To change the state setting logic from event handlers to reducer, we will:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Declare current state(students) as the first argument</li>
      <li>Decalre <code>action</code> object as the second argument</li>
      <li>
        Return the next state from the reducer, which React will set the state
        to
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Migrate all stete setting logics into reducer function:</p>
    <pre>
      function studentReducer(studentList, action) {
        if (action.type === "added") {
          return [
            ...studentList,
            {
              id: action.id,
              name: action.name,
              done: false,
            },
          ];
        } else if (action.type === "changed") {
          return studentList.map((s) => {
            if (s.id === student.id) {
              return student;
            } else {
              return s;
            }
          });
        } else if (action.type === "deleted") {
          return studentList.filter((s) => s.id !== studentId);
        } else {
          throw Error("Unknwon action: " + action.type);
        }
      }
      
    </pre>
    <p>
      This reducer function takes state <code>studentList</code> as an argument,
      which can be declared outside of the component to increase readability.
      However, this code still feels daunting at a glance. We can use
      <code>switch</code> statements, which is actually the convention
    </p>
    <pre>
    
    function studentReducer(studentList, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "added": {
          return [
            ...studentList,
            {
              id: action.id,
              name: action.name,
              done: false,
            },
          ];
        }
        case "changed": {
          return studentList.map((s) => {
            if (s.id === student.id) {
              return student;
            } else {
              return s;
            }
          });
        }
        case "deleted": {
          return studentList.filter((s) => s.id !== studentId);
        }
        default: {
          throw Error("Unknwon action: " + action.type);
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <h2>Step 3: Use the reducer from componnet</h2>
    <p>
      When the reducer function is completed, we need to hook it up with the
      component. We can import it from React:
      <code>import { useReducer } from "react";</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, replace useState
      <code>const [studentList, setStudentList] = useState(initialList)</code
      >with use reduce like
      <code
        >const [studentList, dispatch] = useReducer(studnetReducer,
        initialList)</code
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      The <code>useReducer</code> hook takes an initial state and return a
      stateful value, and a way to setup the state (dispatch function)
    </p>
    <p>It takes two argument: 1. A reducer function, 2. An initial state</p>
    <p>
      returning: 1. A stateful value 2. A dispatch function (to dispatch user
      actions to reducer)
    </p>
    <pre>
    export default function studentReducer(studentList, action) {
      switch (action.type) {
        case "added": {
          return [
            ...studentList,
            {
              id: action.id,
              name: action.name,
              done: false,
            },
          ];
        }
        case "changed": {
          return studentList.map((s) => {
            if (s.id === student.id) {
              return student;
            } else {
              return s;
            }
          });
        }
        case "deleted": {
          return studentList.filter((s) => s.id !== studentId);
        }
        default: {
          throw Error("Unknwon action: " + action.type);
        }
      }
    }
    </pre>
    <div id="studentList2"></div>
    <p>
      In this case, the event handlers only specify what happens when actions are dispatched, while reducer function
      determines how the state updates responding to the dispatched actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Generally, <code>useState</code> is preferred in less complicated code, since it's straightforward. With more event
      handlers, <code>useReducer</code> could compress the code size. In terms of debugging, <code>useReducer</code> is
      better, as the state setting logic and the dispatch are separate from each other, and a console log can be added in
      each code chunk for debuggings. Also, A reducer is purely a function that is independent from other logic. It can be
      exported and tested in a isolated environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reducers, like state updater functions, must be pure. They should have the same outcome from the same input, and does
      not mutate object and arrays while updating them. Each action in a reducer describes only the user interaction. Even
      if there's multiple outcome due to one interaction, only the interaction is dispatched.

    <h1>Writing markup with JSX</h1>
    <p>
      <b>JSX</b> is a syntax extension for JS, which enables HTML-like mark-up
      in a JS file. Modern webs are made of CSS, JS and HTML, they are often
      kept in separate files. Howevere, when webs are more interactive, JS
      becomes in charge of the HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      A React component is essentially a JS function that may also contain
      markup to be renderd. In this case, JSX is the markup, it is similar to
      HTML but stricter and more dynamic
    </p>
    <h2>Convert HTML to JSX</h2>
    <p>Although looks very similar, JSX have some rules to be remembered:</p>
    <h3>1. Return a single root element</h3>
    <p>
      If we wish to return multiple elements from a component, wrap it in a
      single parent tag like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This is based on the fact
      that we are using a JS function in form of React component. Even the JSX
      markup looks like HTML, it is still transfomred into JS objects. Therefore
      making it impossible to return two or more objects without a wrapper like
      a array.
    </p>
    <pre>
      let App = function Gallery() {
        return (
          &lt;section&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Amazing fuhua&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;Profile /&gt;
            &lt;Profile /&gt;
            &lt;Profile /&gt;
          &lt;/section&gt;
        );
      };
    </pre>
    <p>
      The elements can also be wrapped using a pair of empty tags:
      <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/&gt;</code>. To be more specific,
      they are called <b>Fragment</b>, enable grouping things with no traces on
      HTML file
    </p>
    <h3>Close all tags</h3>
    <p>
      JSX requires tags to be closed: self closing tags must be closed within,
      wrappings also must be closed. This is less of a concern because linter
      could help.
    </p>
    <h3>camelCase</h3>
    <p>
      Since JSX would turn to JS, attributes in JSX becomes keys of JS. In the
      components, many attributes should be read as variables in JS. Therefore,
      as JS is unable to read dash and built in reserved naems, camelCase all
      attributes and use their corresponding DOM properties. Two exception are
      <code>aria-</code> and <code>data-</code> for historic reasons.
    </p>
    <h2>JSX with curly braces (JS in JSX)</h2>
    <p>
      HTML are usually written and marked with css and javascript. HTML
      attributes can be set with quotes like the <code>Profile</code> function
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Profile() {
        return &lt;img src="../../../../Imgs/83181495_p0.jpg" alt="Fuhua" /&gt;;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Here, the attributes are being passed as strings by quotes. However, they
      can also be passed with javascript variables, but they need to be wrapped
      with curly braces
    </p>
    <pre>
      export default function Profile(){
        const image = '../../../../Imgs/83181495_p0.jpg';
        const description = 'Fuhua';
        return{-
          src = {image}
          alt = {description}
        }
      }
    </pre>

    <h3>Mixing HTML and JS in JSX</h3>
    <p>
      Along with passing variables in JSX, Javascript variable, functions and
      objects can be directly used in JSX;s html markup.
    </p>
    <pre>
      export default function someFunc(){
        const name = 'Chalin yang'
        return(
          &lt;h1&gt; {name}'s func &lt;/h1&gt;
        )
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      This way, the markup snippet can be changed dynamically via JS variables.
      The same applies to functions that they need to be enclosed by curly
      braces. For objects that already requires a set of curly braces around it,
      they are wrapped with double braces. For example, a html element's style
      can be adjusted by CSS in JSX as a form of object.
    </p>
    <pre>
      export default function someFunc(){
        return(
          &lt;ul style = {{backgroundColor: 'black', color: 'pink'}}&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt;some text&lt;/&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
        )
      }
    </pre>
    <h3>Notes on curly braces</h3>
    <p>In JSX, we use curly braces only at:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        As text in JSX tag, like
        <code>&lt;h1&gt; {name}'s func &lt;/h1&gt;</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        As an attribute immediately after equal sign <code>=</code> Like
        <code>src = {image}</code>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Putting everything together</h3>
    <p>
      It is possible to move many expressions into one big objects in JS, then
      passing that object into JSX with curly braces. An overall example is
      below
    </p>
    <pre>
      const person = {
        name = 'Chalin Yang',
        descriptionTheme = {
          backgroundColor = 'black',
          color: 'pink'
        }
      }

      export default function description(){
        return(
          &lt;div style={person.descriptionTheme}&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt; {person.name}'s description&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;img
              className = 'someCSS'
              src = 'source path'
              alt = 'alt text'
            /&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt; 
            &lt;li&gt;some text&lt;/&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
            );
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Just a sidenote, the inline <code>style</code> properties are written in
      camelCase instead of conventional css attributes for reasons discussed
      earlier.
    </p>
    <h2>Passing Props to a component</h2>
    <p>
      React component use props to communicate with each other. All parent
      component can send some information into child components via
      <b>props</b> in form of any JS value.
    </p>
    <p>
      at the above example, we've already used some props such as
      <code>className</code>, <code>src</code>, <code>alt</code>. They are
      predefined by HTML standard. However, we can define our own component that
      accepts any other props
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1. Passing props to child component</h3>
    <p>
      Again using our <code>Profile</code> example, lets build a child component
      called <code>Avatar</code> and pass some props to it
    </p>
    <pre>
      export default function Profile(){
        return(
          &lt;Avatar
            person = {{name:'Chalin Yang', imageID :'chalin'}}
            size = {100}
          /&gt;
        )
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this case, the props are <code>person</code>, which is a object with
      two key value pairs, <code>size</code>, which is a value in form of JS
      expression since it's quoted by curly braces
    </p>
    <h3>Read props in child component</h3>
    <p>
      The props that were passed down(<code>person, size</code>) can be accessed
      in the child component like a function parameter but quoted with curly
      braces.
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Avatar({ person, size }){
        //some codes
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Now, we can add some codes in the component, where the props can be used
      in rendering.
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Avatar({ CodeName, size }) {
        return (
          &lt;img
            className="avatar"
            src={getPersonInfo(CodeName).imgURL}
            alt={getPersonInfo(CodeName)}
            width={size}
            height={size}
          /&gt;
        );
      }
      
      export default function Profile() {
        return (
          &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;Avatar size={100} CodeName={"Eclipse"} /&gt;
            &lt;Avatar size={80} CodeName={"WhiteNight"} /&gt;
            &lt;Avatar size={60} CodeName={"Xunyu"} /&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        );
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      In the above code snippet, the Avatar receive props from its parent
      function <code>Profile</code>. In this case, the props are defined from a
      library, which is later dynamically set in the parent component. By
      altering these props, child components can be modified. The above code
      would generate the following markup
    </p>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <p>
      To be more specific, the props being passed to child are like arguments
      for functions. They are the only argument in a React component in form of
      a object. For example, one can use the full version of props as object:
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Avatar(props) {
        let person = props.person;
        let size = props.size;
        // ...
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      However, this is equivalent to
      <code>function Avatar({person, size})</code>. The curly braces
      <b>deconstructs</b> the props object down into single parameters
    </p>
    <h3>Default value for props</h3>
    <p>
      simlar to functions, a prop can also be predefined to a value. Simply add
      the value in the deconstruing syntax like
      <code>function Avatar({ person, size = 100}){//...}</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the component <code>&lt;Avatar person = {...}/&gt;</code> is rendered
      with no size props, it will be <code>100</code>. If an value was specified
      , it will not be used.
    </p>
    <h2>Forward prop with JSX syntax</h2>
    <p>
      sometimes, there are many props to be passed. They can be specified using
      the deconstruting syntax but it might be repetitive. The
      <code>spread</code> syntax of JSX can help.
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Profile(props){
        return (
          &lt;div className = 'card'&gt;
            &lt;Avatar {...props}/&gt;
          &lt;/div&gt;
        );
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this case, all of <code>Profile</code>'s props are passed to child
      <code>Avatar</code> without being listed every time because of the
      <code>...</code> spread syntax.
    </p>
    <h3>Passing JSX as children</h3>
    <p>It is very common to see webs use nested tags like</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;div&gt;
        &lt;img/&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      To create the same effect in a component via JSX tag. The parent component
      will receive a <code>children</code> prop as the content being nested.
    </p>
    <pre>
      
    function Gallery({ children }) {
      return &lt;div className="gallery"&gt;{children}&lt;/div&gt;;
    }

    function ProfileFlex() {
      return (
        &lt;Gallery&gt;
          &lt;Avatar size={100} CodeName={"Eclipse"} /&gt;
          &lt;Avatar size={80} CodeName={"WhiteNight"} /&gt;
          &lt;Avatar size={60} CodeName={"Xunyu"} /&gt;
        &lt;/Gallery&gt;
      );
    </pre>
    <p>
      The code above defines a new component called <code>Gallery</code>, which
      takes a prop called children. This <code>children</code> prop are filled
      with the <code>Avatar</code> components when the
      <code>Gallery</code> component wraps them. They create the following
      effect
    </p>
    <div id="gallery2"></div>
    <h2>Props over time</h2>
    <p>
      In fact, props are <b>NOT</b> static. They can change due time, which
      helps being interactive. They reflect a component's data at any point of
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, props are immutable, if a component needs to change its props
      like new data or interaction. They have to be passed a different prop
      (different object). Props cannot be changed, if interactivity is needed,
      we would need to set state.
    </p>

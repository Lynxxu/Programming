    <h1>Writing markup with JSX</h1>
    <p>
      <b>JSX</b> is a syntax extension for JS, which enables HTML-like mark-up
      in a JS file. Modern webs are made of CSS, JS and HTML, they are often
      kept in separate files. Howevere, when webs are more interactive, JS
      becomes in charge of the HTML.
    </p>
    <p>
      A React component is essentially a JS function that may also contain
      markup to be renderd. In this case, JSX is the markup, it is similar to
      HTML but stricter and more dynamic
    </p>
    <h2>Convert HTML to JSX</h2>
    <p>Although looks very similar, JSX have some rules to be remembered:</p>
    <h3>1. Return a single root element</h3>
    <p>
      If we wish to return multiple elements from a component, wrap it in a
      single parent tag like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>. This is based on the fact
      that we are using a JS function in form of React component. Even the JSX
      markup looks like HTML, it is still transfomred into JS objects. Therefore
      making it impossible to return two or more objects without a wrapper like
      a array.
    </p>
    <pre>
      let App = function Gallery() {
        return (
          &lt;section&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Amazing fuhua&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;Profile /&gt;
            &lt;Profile /&gt;
            &lt;Profile /&gt;
          &lt;/section&gt;
        );
      };
    </pre>
    <p>
      The elements can also be wrapped using a pair of empty tags:
      <code>&lt;&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/&gt;</code>. To be more specific,
      they are called <b>Fragment</b>, enable grouping things with no traces on
      HTML file
    </p>
    <h3>Close all tags</h3>
    <p>
      JSX requires tags to be closed: self closing tags must be closed within,
      wrappings also must be closed. This is less of a concern because linter
      could help.
    </p>
    <h3>camelCase</h3>
    <p>
      Since JSX would turn to JS, attributes in JSX becomes keys of JS. In the
      components, many attributes should be read as variables in JS. Therefore,
      as JS is unable to read dash and built in reserved naems, camelCase all
      attributes and use their corresponding DOM properties. Two exception are
      <code>aria-</code> and <code>data-</code> for historic reasons.

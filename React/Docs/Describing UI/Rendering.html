    <h1>Rendering Element</h1>
    <p>
      To render a React component, we first need to define a 'root' DOM mode in
      the HTML file, which will be manipulated by React. For example,
      <code>&lt;div id = 'root'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, create the root element using <code>ReactDOM.createRoot()</code> or
      <code>createRoot()</code>, both equivalent. Then, the created root(DOM)
      element was created and the React element can be rendered using
      <code>root.render(element)</code>
    </p>
    <h2>Conditional Rendering</h2>
    <p>
      It is worth mentioning that components being displayed could vary due
      situations. Therefore, there is a need for rendering elements based on
      certain conditions.
    </p>
    <h2>Conditional returning JSX</h2>
    <p>
      Say we have a component that checks the luggage of a perons, return if
      it's packed or not, rendering some <code>items</code> that can be marked
      as packed or not
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Item({name, isPacked}){
        return &lt;li className = 'item'&gt; {name} &lt;/li&gt;
      }

      export default function PackingList(){
        return (
          &lt;section&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Jim's luggage list&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;
            &lt;Item
                  isPacked = {true}
                  name = 'Lube'
            /&gt;
            &lt;Item
                  isPacked = {true}
                  name = 'tissue paper'
            /&gt;
            &lt;Item
                  isPacked = {false}
                  name = 'Javalin'
            /&gt;
            &lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/section&gt;
        )
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Now it can be seen that, the corresponding item have a prop called
      <code>isPacked</code> which contains info on whether it's packed or not.
      We can add a checkmark beside it to indicate it's packed.
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Item({ name, isPacked }){
        if (isPacked){
          return &lt;li className = 'item'&gt; {name} √ &lt;/li&gt;
        }
        return return &lt;li className = 'item'&gt; {name} &lt;/li&gt;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>The generated code would have the following effect:</p>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <h2>Conditional (ternary) operator</h2>
    <p>
      as the above code is valid and ok, but it is repetitive. It's better to
      avoid repetition. So a JS syntax called ternary operator can help. Rewrite
      the code to:
    </p>
    <pre>
      return(
        &lt;li className = 'item'&gt;
          {isPacked ? name + ‘√' : name }
        &lt;li&gt;
      );
    </pre>
    <p>
      This simply means that, if <code>isPacked</code> is true, then
      <code>?</code> render <code>name + '√'</code>, else <code>:</code> render
      <code>name</code>
    </p>
    <p>
      This syntax can be further expanded. For example, say I want to cross out
      the items that are packed by using <code>&lt;del&gt;</code>. Then simply
      expand the tenary syntax:
    </p>
    <pre>
      return(
        &lt;li className = 'item'&gt;
          {isPacked ? (
            &lt;del&gt;
            name + ‘√' 
            &lt;/del&gt;
             ): 
             (name) 
            }
        &lt;li&gt;
      );
    </pre>
    <p>It would have the following effect</p>
    <div id="crossed"></div>
    <h3>AND operator</h3>
    <p>
      JS logical AND <code>&&</code> operator is another useful one. Again using
      the checkmark example, without the AND operator, we would have to write if
      statement. However, we can write using AND as below:
    </p>
    <pre>
      return (
        &lt;li&gt;
          {name} {isPacked && '√'};
      )
     </pre
    >
    <p>
      This code basically says
      <i
        >if <code>isPacked</code>, then (<code>&&</code>) render the
        <code>√</code></i
      >. The logcial AND operator would return the value of its right side
      <b>IF </b>the left side (condition) is true. This works based on
      evaluation of left side as a bollean. Therefore implicating that
      non-bollean type like numbers may raise a issue when putting on the left
      side(could be rendered )
    </p>
    <h3>Conditionally assigning JSX to var</h3>
    <p>
      Except the above two ways, there is also another method, which defines JSX
      based on variables. It is verbose but flexible. Using the checkmarked
      luggage list again:
    </p>
    <pre>
      function Item ({ name, isPacked}){
        let itemContent = name;
        if (isPacked){
          itemContent = name + '√'
        }
        return(
          &lt;li className = 'item'&gt;
            {itemContent}
          &lt;/li&gt;
        )
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Keeping the parent component the same, we have updated the Item function
      so that it could generate different JSX by assignment of varibles.
    </p>
    <h2>Rendering lists</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes it is necessary to display a collection of data. In this case,
      JS array method to manipulate an array of data. Using
      <code>filter()</code>, <code>map()</code> methods, an array of data can be
      transformed into an array of component.
    </p>
    <h3>rendering data from array</h3>
    <p>Here's a list of content</p>
    <pre>
      &lt;ul&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Jim: Biochemistry&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Will: Chemistry&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Chalin: Math & Stat&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;li&gt;Oscar: Cognitive science&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      In this list, it is very obvious to see that there is only difference in
      content between all list items. In this case, we can store the content
      into a JS array, then use <code>map()</code> and <code>filter()</code> to
      render list of component from them
    </p>
    <p>Firstly, move the data into an array</p>
    <pre>
      const people = {
        'Jim: Biochemistry',
        'WIll: Chemistry',
        'Chalin: Math and Stats'
        'Oscar: cog science'
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      Then, simply map the <code>people</code> members into a new array of JSX
      nodes called <code>listItems</code> by
      <code
        >const listItem = people.map(person =>
        <li>{person}</li>
        )</code
      >. Now it can be returned from the component:
      <code
        >return
        <ul>
          {listItems}
        </ul></code
      >
    </p>
    <p>The full code is as follows:</p>
    <pre>
      
      function List1(){
        const listItem = people.map(person =&gt; {
          &lt;li&gt;{person}&lt;/li&gt;
        })
        return &lt;ul&gt;{listItem}&lt;/ul&gt;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>This would generate the following block of code:</p>
    <div id="list1"></div>
    <h3>Filtering array of items</h3>
    <p>The data can be even more structurally complex:</p>
    <pre>
      const people2 = [
      {
        id: 0,
        name: "Jim",
        major: "BioChem",
      },
      {
        id: 1,
        name: "Will",
        major: "Chem",
      },
      {
        id: 2,
        name: "Chalin",
        major: "math and stats",
      },
      {
        name: "Oscar",
        major: "cog sci",
      },
      {
        name: "KK",
        major: "Chem",
      },
    ];
    </pre>
    <p>
      This is a more structured array of objects. If for some reason I only want
      to display a student majoring in chemistry, the JS
      <code>filter()</code> method can be used. It takes an array of items,
      passing it through a test which returns a bollean, returning a new array
      with all items that are successfully passed
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case, an easy test function can be
      <code>(person) => person.major ==='Chem'</code>, which the complete code
      would be:
    </p>
    <pre>
      const chemists = people2.filter((person) =&gt; person.major === "Chem");

      function List2() {
        const listItem2 = chemists.map((person) =&gt; &lt;li&gt;Name: {person.name}&lt;/li&gt;);
        return (
          &lt;&gt;
            &lt;h3&gt;List of Chem major students&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;ul&gt;{listItem2}&lt;/ul&gt;
          &lt;/&gt;
        );
      }
    </pre>
    <p>The code would have the following effect</p>
    <div id="list2"></div>
    <p>
      It must be noted that, in a arrow function. If the function is enclosed by
      curly braces, then a <code>return</code> statement must be written. If
      not, return is implicitly done.
    </p>
    <h3>Using <code>key</code> to keep list in order</h3>
    <p>
      if U open dev tools, u can see warnings for both examples above, which
      says that each child in a list should have a unique 'key' prop. This means
      that it is necessary to give each array item a <code>key</code>, which is
      a unique identifier for it in a array.
    </p>
    <p>
      To do this, it is suggested to include a key in the data array. Then pass
      it down in the list item as a prop, simply edit the
      <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> tag into <code>&lt;li key = {person.id}&gt;</code>
    </p>
    <h3>More on keys</h3>
    <p>
      Source of keys: They can be gathered from data in a database, most of the
      time database keys are unique by nature. Or it can be logically generated
      data, which applies to locally stored data, then packages can be used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keys must be unique in a array, but can be repeated in different arrays.
      They should not be changed at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Keys in React are very much required because it gives React an idea of
      which data belongs to which, they are like file names in a folder of
      files, serving as unique identifiers for React. Even with postition
      changes, React would be able to identify that component using its ID and
      operate it.
    </p>
    <p>Some important things to be noted:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <code>key</code> cannot be replaced by indexing. The position of a item
        in an array could be changed by interactions and JS dynamics, leading to
        bugs
      </li>
      <li>
        Simliary, do not geenrate IDs on the page. Have a stable
        <code>key</code> for each item. Re-generating each time would lead to
        poor performance and losing all user input on the item, since re-render
        would generate a new one.
      </li>
      <li>
        The <code>key</code> is only a hint for React, components won't receive
        the <code>key</code> as a prop. if necessary, pass it into a separate
        prop a id that will be used. Like
        <code>&lt;Profile key ={id} userId = {id}/&gt;</code>
      </li>
    </ul>

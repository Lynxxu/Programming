    <h1>Describing the UI</h1>
    <p>
      React
      为一个JS库，专门用于渲染UI。React可以将许多小的units，比如buttons，images，texts加在一起，变成reusable
      nestable <b>components</b>。我将在这个页面学习react
      component的创建，定义和显示等操作。
    </p>
    <h2>First component</h2>
    <p>
      React applications are built from small isoalted pieces of UI called
      <b>components</b>. A react component is a JS function which can be
      changed, it can be small as a buttonm and large as an webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using HTMl, markup structures like a ordered list can be created, combined
      with css and JS. React would combine all the css, js and HTML into custom
      components that are resulable UI elements. Some open source communitites
      already have thousnads of components to be used like
      <a href="https://mui.com/core/">MUI</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Define a component</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, web devs would write html, markup and add interaction via
      JS. It is now cumbersome and difficult if it were to be repeated thousands
      of times. React makes them reusable, but at the end of day,
      <b
        >a React component is a JS funciton that you can sprinkle wiht markup</b
      >. A block of code like below would generate 
      <pre>
        export default function Profile() {
          return (
            &lt;img
              src="My waifu"
              alt="Noelle"
            /&gt;
          )
        }        
      </pre>
    </p>
    <h3>Step 1: Export the component</h3>
    <p>
      <code>export defautl</code> is a standard JS syntax that allows the funciton to be exported to other fiels to be used. See later sections 
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: define function</h3>
    <p>
      Using <code>function Profile() {}</code>, this defines a JS function with name Profile. Note that a React component must start with <b>CAPITALIZED</b> letter, unlike regular functions 
    </p>
  </body>
  <script>
    export default function Profile() {
      return (
        <img src="../../../Imgs/小识猫猫.jpg" alt="my waifu" />
      );
    }

  </script>
</html>

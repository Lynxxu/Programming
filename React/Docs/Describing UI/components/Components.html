    <h1>Describing the UI</h1>
    <p>
      React
      为一个JS库，专门用于渲染UI。React可以将许多小的units，比如buttons，images，texts加在一起，变成reusable
      nestable <b>components</b>。我将在这个页面学习react
      component的创建，定义和显示等操作。
    </p>
    <h2>First component</h2>
    <p>
      React applications are built from small isoalted pieces of UI called
      <b>components</b>. A react component is a JS function which can be
      changed, it can be small as a buttonm and large as an webpage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using HTMl, markup structures like a ordered list can be created, combined
      with css and JS. React would combine all the css, js and HTML into custom
      components that are resulable UI elements. Some open source communitites
      already have thousnads of components to be used like
      <a href="https://mui.com/core/">MUI</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Define a component</h2>
    <p>
      Traditionally, web devs would write html, markup and add interaction via
      JS. It is now cumbersome and difficult if it were to be repeated thousands
      of times. React makes them reusable, but at the end of day,
      <b>a React component is a JS funciton that you can sprinkle wiht markup</b
      >. A block of code like below would generate
    </p>
    <pre>
        export default function Profile() {
          return (
            &lt;img
              src="My waifu"
              alt="Noelle"
            /&gt;
          )
        }        
      </pre
    >

    <h3>Step 1: Export the component</h3>
    <p>
      <code>export defautl</code> is a standard JS syntax that allows the
      funciton to be exported to other fiels to be used. See later sections
    </p>
    <h3>Step 2: define function</h3>
    <p>
      Using <code>function Profile() {}</code>, this defines a JS function with
      name Profile. Note that a React component must start with
      <b>CAPITALIZED</b> letter, unlike regular functions
    </p>
    <h3>Step 3: Add markup</h3>
    <p>
      as written, this component would return an <code>img</code> tag with
      <code>scr</code> and <code>alt</code> attribute. It is like a html bnut
      it's acutally JS. This syntax is called JSX, which enables markup inside
      JS.
    </p>
    <p>the return statement can also be writte with one line.Like:</p>
    <pre>return &lt;img src='source.jpg' alt ='some alt text'/&gt;</pre>
    <p>
      However, if the markup spans over multiple lines, it must be included in a
      pair of parentheses:
    </p>
    <pre>
      return (
        &lt;div&gt;
          &lt;img src = 'sth' alt='sth'&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
      )
    </pre>
    <p>
      At here, a component was finished, with fist line, enabling export of the
      component to other files. Defined using
      <code>function Profile(){}</code> like a noraml JS function but
      capitalized. Which is then implemented with a markup that can return a img
      with specified attributes
    </p>
    <h2>Using a component</h2>
    <p>
      Now we defined a <code>Profile component</code>. It can be added to a html
      as if it's a part of it. However, there are several things to do before
      adding it:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Remeber to import react script tags like
        <code>react.development.js</code> or via a importmap
      </li>
      <li>
        Import Babel as complier so that browser can read JSX and React syntax
      </li>
      <li>Note in the react js file <code> type="text/babel"</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Then, we can nest the React functions inside one other. The
      <code>Profile</code> function is finished and can be nested like below:
    </p>
    <pre>
      export default function Gallery(){
        &lt;section&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Amazing Fuhua&gt;
          &lt;Profile/&gt;
          &lt;Profile/&gt;
          &lt;Profile/&gt;
        &lt;section&gt;
      }
    </pre>
    <p>and we would have the following effect:</p>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <p>
      In browser, this process is quite straightforward. &lt;section&gt; is
      lowercase so it's a HTML tag, but &lt;Profile&gt; is capitalized so we are
      calling a component called <code>Profile</code>. Therefore, in browser,
      they are equivalent to the codes below
    </p>
    <pre>
    &lt;section&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Amazing Fuhua&gt;
      &lt;img src="../../../../Imgs/83181495_p0.jpg" alt="Fuhua/&gt;
      &lt;img src="../../../../Imgs/83181495_p0.jpg" alt="Fuhua/&gt;
      &lt;img src="../../../../Imgs/83181495_p0.jpg" alt="Fuhua/&gt;
    &lt;section&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>
      Another thing to be mentioned is that, to nest components, a component
      should <b>NOT</b> be defined in another component. It should be
      separatedly declared
    </p>

    <h2>Importing and exporting components</h2>
    <p>
      As mentioned in the previous part, we made a component named
      <code>Profile</code> that can be exported and saved in
      <code>component.js</code>. For reasons like resuability, we can write the
      module in separate files for management. To do this we can use the import
      and export functions
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, we can create a <code>Gallery</code> js file, which includes
      both the <code>Profile</code> and <code>Gallery</code> method. Remeber to
      include <code>export defualt</code> for the intend export file
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in another separate js file, we can write the following code to
      import the method:
    </p>
    <pre>
    import Gallery from './Gallery.js'

    export default function App(){
      return (
        &lt;Gallery /&gt;
      );
    }
  </pre
    >
    <p>
      The logic in here is that <code>Gallery.js</code> defines the
      <code>Profile</code> component to be used internally in Gallery (not
      exported). Then exports the <code>Gallery</code> component as default
      export. In <code>App.js</code>, the <code>Gallery</code> is imported as a
      default import from <code>Gallery.js</code>, while the root
      <code>App</code> component is exported default
    </p>
    <h2>Export and import in the same file from multiple files</h2>
    <p>
      What if I wish to import both the <code>Gallery</code> and
      <code>Profile</code> method in one file. This can be done using a mix of
      default export and named export. It is important to note that there is
      <b>only one</b> default export per file. Therefore, The rest of the method
      needs to be named export. In the export statement, they simply remove the
      <code>default</code> keyword. In the import statement, they add a pair of
      curly braces in the name of the imported component.
    </p>
    <p>So, in <code>Gallery.js</code>, the code will be updated as:</p>
    <pre>
    export funciton Profile(){
      return (
        &lt;img
          src = "some directories"
          alt = "alt tetxt"
        /&gt;
      );
    }

    export default function Gallery (){
      return(
        &lt;section&gt;
          &lt;h1&gt;Amazing fuhuas &lt;/h1&gt;
          &lt;Profile /&gt;
          &lt;Profile /&gt;
          &lt;Profile /&gt;
        &lt;/section&gt;
      );
    }
  </pre
    >
    <p>in the App.js file, where both components are being imported:</p>
    <pre>
      import Gallery from './Gallery.js'
      import { Profile } from './Gallery.js'

      export default function App(){
        return(
          &lt;Profile /&gt;
        );
      }
    </pre>
    <p>
      The relation between files are simply yet intertwined. The
      <code>Gallery.js</code> exports both component, one with default one with
      name. In <code>App.js</code>, the <code>Gallery</code> component is
      imported as default, <code>Profile</code> is imported as name component
      with curly braces. Later, it exports App.
